### Welcome! I am a Master's candidate in Internaional Affairs Candidate at Columbia's School of International and Political Affairs. I am learning python to bolster my research around migration/refugee policy in the U.S. My favorite team is the Washington Wizards but I watch one game per year to make sure they're still bad. Say hello!
